# count_magic

<Prototype>int count_magic(string script[9])</Prototype>

`count_magic()` counts the number of items with the script script in the magic inventory. Interestingly, the specified script need not actually exist: it only has to be the same as the corresponding [add_magic()](./add-magic.md) command's script-name argument.
