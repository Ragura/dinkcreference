# dink_can_walk_off_screen

<Prototype>void dink_can_walk_off_screen(bool can_walk_off_screen)</Prototype>

`dink_can_walk_off_screen()` allows Dink to walk off the current screen without scrolling to an adjoining screen if `can_walk_off_screen` is 1. It probably isn't a good idea to set this when the player has control of Dink.
