# fade_down

<Prototype>void fade_down(void)</Prototype>

`fade_down()` causes the screen to fade to black. The script will pause during the fade down process.

It is generally a good idea to freeze Dink before fading down, as the player will still be able to move otherwise.

When the screen has faded to black, all text will appear as white, and all white pixels will remain visible.
