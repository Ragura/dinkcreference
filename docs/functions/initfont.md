# initfont

<Prototype>void initfont(string[31] font)</Prototype>

`initfont()` will cause the game to use font for all current and future text. Note that the font must be installed as a normal font (in the Windows/Fonts folder on Windows). The default font is `'Arial'`, and `'Times New Roman'`, `'Arial Narrow'`, and `'Arial Bold'` will work fine, among others.
