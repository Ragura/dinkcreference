Removed from the game

</VersionInfo>

In early development versions of Dink Smallwood, this command was used to call an external `dplay.exe` file to play avi movies. However, this was not implemented in the final game as it didn't work very well.

Before the Dink Smallwood source code was released, Dan Walma used this command to add additional features, like changing maps. He released dPlay, a replacement for `dplay.exe`. No D-Mods were released that took advantage of this functionality.
