# push_active

<Prototype>void push_active(bool dink_can_push)</Prototype>

`push_active()` will allow Dink to push objects (and play the push sequence) if `dink_can_push` is 1. Dink is able to push things by default.

This is useful if the player changes into a character that doesn't have push sequences (such as when Dink becomes a duck in *Mystery Island*).
