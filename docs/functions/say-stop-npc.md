# say_stop_npc

<Prototype>int say_stop_npc(string dialogue[199], int active_sprite)</Prototype>

`say_stop_npc()` behaves like [say_stop()](./say-stop.md), except the player cannot skip the dialogue by pressing the <kbd>space bar</kbd>. This is useful in situations where two characters are talking in the background.
