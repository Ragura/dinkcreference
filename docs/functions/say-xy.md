# say_xy

<Prototype>int say_xy(string dialogue[199], int x, int y)</Prototype>

`say_xy()` behaves like `say()`, except the dialogue is attached to sprite 1000 and it will appear centered around the given x and y coordinates. Also, the dialogue will not start new lines every couple hundred pixels.
