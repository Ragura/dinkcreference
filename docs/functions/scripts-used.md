`scripts_used()` will return the number of scripts being used right now.

In a well-behaved, well-debugged dmod, the count will be a total of the following:

- 1 if a script is attached to the screen Dink is currently on (in DinkEdit terms, if this "map" has a "base script").
- 1 for Dink's currently-armed weapon.
- 1 for Dink's currently-armed magic spell, if he knows magic.
- 1 for every sprite on the screen with an attached script, regardless of whether the same or different scripts are attached. (For example, in a screen with four pillbugs, the count will include 4 for the pillbugs, even though `en-pill.c` might be attached to each one. Every sprite gets its own separate "instance" of an attached script.)
- 1 for any script that has done a [script_attach](./script-attach.md)(1000) and not done a [kill_this_task()](./kill-this-task.md).
- 1 for any script that has done a [script_attach](./script-attach.md)(0) while Dink was on the current screen.
- 1 for any active `key-##` summoned scripts.

If there are more scripts than expected, you probably have not been using [kill_this_task()](./kill-this-task.md) from spawned or [script_attach](./script-attach.md)(1000) scripts.
