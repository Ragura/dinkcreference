# sp_clip_top

<Prototype>int sp_clip_top(int active_sprite, int pixels[-1])</Prototype>

`sp_clip_left()` gets or sets the number of `pixels` to clip off of the top of the `active_sprite's` sequence and frame. If the `active_sprite` changes sequence or frame, the clipping will remain.

This is equivalent to the clipping performed in the map editor.
