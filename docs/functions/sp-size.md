# sp_size

<Prototype>int sp_size(int active_sprite, int size[-1])</Prototype>

`sp_size()` gets or sets the `size` of the `active_sprite`. The `size` is a percentage.

A `size` of 100 is normal and a `size` of 200 is twice the sprite's original size. Note that resizing many sprites may cause a performance hit.
