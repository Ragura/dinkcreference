<Prototype>int sp_y(int active_sprite, int y_coordinate[-1])</Prototype>

`sp_y()` gets or sets the `y_coordinate` of `active_sprite`.

The `y_coordinate` is where the sprite exists on the screen vertically. The top of the screen is 0, just above the status bar is 400, and the bottom of the screen is 480.
