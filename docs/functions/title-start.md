# title_start

<Prototype>void title_start(void)</Prototype>

`title_start()` defines the beginning of a title section of a choice statement. Everything following `title_start()` up until `title_end()` will be interpreted as the choice statement's title. It should always exist within `choice_start()` and `choice_end()` commands.
